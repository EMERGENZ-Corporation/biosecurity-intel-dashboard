# Dashboard Restoration Handoff Log

**Last updated:** 2026-05-20 (after tab sweep — all restoration items complete)
**Purpose:** Multi-session restoration of the biosecurity-intel-dashboard to the depth of the original hantavirus-intel-dashboard. If you are a new agent picking this up, start here.

---

## Background

The repository was migrated from a single-threat hantavirus dashboard to a multi-threat biosecurity scaffold in commits `f39f8a4`, `cfd08bb`, `90bd172`, and `f4ebe5c` (Mar–May 2026). The migration **stripped substantial depth** — news feed, deep clinical pages, source-attributed content blocks, US monitoring tables, EMS briefing cards, flight tracing, dark-mode map with typed markers, and a comprehensive About/Legal page.

The user wants the depth restored, **adapted for the broader multi-threat scope** (16 signals across 10 categories, not just hantavirus). All restoration work must adhere to [CONTENT-STANDARDS.md](CONTENT-STANDARDS.md).

### Deleted-content recovery points
The original hantavirus components and pages can be retrieved from git history:
- **`f4ebe5c^`** — last commit with old `scripts/update-data.mjs`, `src/components/*.tsx` (GlobalMap, USMonitoringTable, EMSBriefingCard, FlightTracingPanel, Timeline, SourceChip, ShareModal, MapLayerToggle, ContentBlock), and `src/data/*.json` (news, markers, ems-briefing, us-monitoring, flights, meta, timeline, protocols, sources, manual-overrides)
- **`90bd172^`** — last commit with old `src/pages/*.tsx` (About, Clinical, Dashboard, Genomics, News, PPE, Protocols, Sources)

To inspect: `git show <ref>:<path>` — example: `git show f4ebe5c^:src/data/news.json`

## Restoration plan (in order)

1. ✅ **News feed** — page + pipeline + workflow
2. ✅ **About & Legal page** — multi-threat adaptation
3. ✅ **Map** — dark CARTO + typed markers + seed data
4. ✅ **SignalDetail / ContentBlock** — per-block source attribution
5. ✅ **Overview page** — restored briefing/news/monitoring rails
6. ✅ **Sweep remaining tabs** — Timeline, Briefings, Sources, Resources, SignalCard

**All six restoration items shipped.** Future work is now polish, content deepening, or new features — see "Outstanding work" below for backlog ideas.

---

## ✅ Completed

### 1. News feed (commit `b0c0753`)
- `src/pages/News.tsx` — multi-signal filter tabs, authority-color cards, signal tag chips
- `scripts/update-news.mjs` — RSS-only pipeline (17 global feeds + per-signal Google News queries), tags items with `signalIds[]`, deduplicates, caps at 200, no API keys
- `src/data/news.json` — seeded with 31 hantavirus items from history; ~200 after first pipeline run
- `.github/workflows/update-news.yml` — runs every 6h on schedule + on signal data changes
- `src/types.ts` — added `NewsItem` interface
- NavBar + App route + `update:news` script wired
- `fast-xml-parser` added as devDependency

**Verify:** `npm run update:news`, then `npm run dev` and visit `/news`.

### 2. About & Legal page (commit `0591b49`)
- `src/pages/AboutPage.tsx` — 12-card layout adapted from hantavirus version
- Cards: About This Dashboard (links CONTENT-STANDARDS.md), About EMERGENZ Corp (EIN 93-4070519, DE/CA), Who this is for, What it is not, Source provenance & tier system, Data currency & cadence, Resilience, Legal Disclaimer, Privacy, MIT License (full text), WHO Content Attribution Notice (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO), U.S. Government Content Notice (17 U.S.C. §105)
- GitHub URL updated to `biosecurity-intel-dashboard`
- Data currency clause updated for current cadence

**Verify:** visit `/about`.

### 3. Map (commit `8196828`)
- `src/types.ts` — `MarkerType` union (8 multi-threat categories), `MarkerSource`, expanded `SignalMapMarker`
- `src/utils/signals.ts` — `MARKER_TYPE_COLORS` palette, `markerRadius` helper
- `src/components/SignalsMap.tsx` — rewritten: dark CARTO tiles, CircleMarker, dark popup styling, source links in popup
- `src/pages/MapPage.tsx` — added marker-type filter row alongside severity and category, color-swatch chips, visible-marker count
- `scripts/seed-map-markers.mjs` — one-time seeder that wrote 103 typed markers across all 16 signals (hantavirus 15, Ebola 7, measles 8, mpox 7, H5 8, cholera 7, lassa 6, chikungunya 6, FIFA 8, wastewater 3–6 each, etc.)
- `src/data/signals.json` — markers field populated for all 16 signals

**Verify:** visit `/map`. Tile URL should contain `cartocdn.com/dark_all`. Marker counter shows "103 markers visible". Click marker → dark popup with type label and source links.

### 4. SignalDetail / ContentBlock (commit pending push)
- `src/types.ts` — added `SectionAttribution` interface; `SignalDetailSection` extended with optional `attribution`, `additionalAttributions[]`
- `src/components/ContentBlock.tsx` — new component: title + body paragraphs + per-block source-attribution footer with primary "Source:" row and "Also:" rows for additional sources, plus optional License badge and lastReviewed line
- `src/components/SourceChip.tsx` — restored from history; renders "Authority · Document title · Date ↗" chip
- `src/pages/SignalDetail.tsx` — `detailSections[]` now rendered via ContentBlock (was: plain `<Paragraph>` per `\n\n` split)
- `scripts/seed-section-attribution.mjs` — one-time seeder:
  - Hantavirus 5 existing sections: layered structured attribution (CDC HAN 528, NYC DOH HAN #8, NETEC, WHO DON601, etc.) onto unchanged bodyMarkdown
  - Other 15 signals: added a single "Operational guidance" / "Mass-gathering health preparedness" section with primary + 1-2 additional attributions sourced from CDC, WHO, USDA APHIS, WOAH, PAHO, ECDC, Africa CDC, WastewaterSCAN
- Total: 20 attributed sections (5 hantavirus + 15 new)

**Verify:** visit `/signals/andes-hantavirus-mv-hondius-2026` — 5 ContentBlocks each with Source: chip and Also: rows. Visit `/signals/avian-influenza-h5-2026` — Operational guidance ContentBlock with USDA APHIS source chip. `npm run validate:data` passes.

### 5. Overview page rails (commit pending push)
- `src/pages/Overview.tsx` — restructured with 7 sections plus stat strip:
  - Status strip adds **News items** stat chip alongside existing (active signals, highest severity, domains, stale signals)
  - **Active operational briefings** rail (NEW, EMERGENZ accent border) — pulls signals at severity >= concern, surfaces the `ems-specific` / `operational-guidance` / `protocols-and-guidance` section, shows severity chip, category, section title + authority, and a 2-sentence summary card. Top 3, sorted by severity rank. Each card links to the signal detail page.
  - Priority signal queue (preserved)
  - Threat domain coverage + Data currency (preserved, Data currency now also shows news item count)
  - **Latest authority & media coverage** (NEW) — 5 most-recent items from `news.json`, authority color stripe, signal chips, links external to source
  - Signal map preview (preserved, dark CARTO via SignalsMap rewrite)
  - Recent developments timeline (preserved)
- Authority color map + signal short-name map mirror the News page so chips render consistently.

**Verify:** visit `/`. Expect 7 section headers above; "Active operational briefings" shows hantavirus + concern-level signals; latest news rail shows 5 items with signal chips; mini-map renders dark tiles with 100+ markers.

---

### 6. Tab sweep (commit pending push)
- **Briefings (`/briefings`):** complete rebuild. Each signal at severity Watch+ rendered as a card surfacing its `ems-specific` / `operational-guidance` / `protocols-and-guidance` / `clinical-profile` section (whichever is present, in that priority). Card shows severity pill, category, geography, signal name link, operational relevance, a tinted preview box with section title and first 2 paragraphs + "Read full briefing →" link, and a footer SourceChip pulling from `section.attribution` (falls back to primarySourceId). Severity + category filters.
- **Timeline (`/timeline`):** event card `borderLeft` now uses the signal's severity color (was always blue). Each event includes a severity pill matching the signal. Source link replaced with a proper `SourceChip`. Added severity filter alongside category. Events grouped by month with EMERGENZ-accent month headers. Header shows event count and signal count.
- **SignalCard:** added depth indicators (markers / sections / news counts) rendered as small mono chips. Reads from `signal.mapMarkers`, `signal.detailSections`, and matches against `news.json` by `signalIds`. Counts surface signal depth at-a-glance on `/signals` and on Overview.
- **Sources (`/sources`):** added tier-breakdown summary grid at the top (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 with count and tier color); tier filter chips; per-source `borderLeft` colored by tier instead of primary/secondary; tier pill in card header. References CONTENT-STANDARDS.md §1 in the intro card.
- **Resources (`/resources`):** per-source `borderLeft` switched from primary/secondary (green/purple) to tier-colored. Result count shown in header ("N of M shown").
- **Tier color palette:** Tier 1 green, Tier 2 blue, Tier 3 yellow, Tier 4 orange. Defined identically in both SourcesPage.tsx and Resources.tsx.

**Verify:** `/briefings` shows 12 cards each with Source: footer; `/timeline` groups by month with severity stripes and SourceChip footers; `/signals` first card shows depth badges ("7 markers", "1 sections", "83 news"); `/sources` shows tier breakdown grid + tier filter (Tier 1: 19, Tier 2: 11, Tier 3: 4, Tier 4: 0); `/resources` borderLeft now tier-colored.

## ⏳ Outstanding work (backlog)

These are not part of the original 6-item restoration plan but are natural next steps:

- **Deepen non-hantavirus detailSections.** Each of the 15 non-hantavirus signals currently has 1 "Operational guidance" section. Deepen to 3-5 ContentBlocks each (clinical, surveillance, infection control, lab diagnostics, vaccination/prophylaxis where applicable), modeled on the hantavirus signal.
- **Tier 4 sources empty (0 in registry).** Add 2-3 representative preprints (bioRxiv/medRxiv) to demonstrate the tier system end-to-end.
- **Custom domain** `biosecurity-intel.emergenzsystems.org` still does not resolve. Workflows point at `biosecurity-intel-dashboard.vercel.app`. Swap back via env var or workflow edit once DNS is configured.
- **Pipeline §4.4 gap.** `update-news.mjs` writes `news.json` even when zero new items are added; CONTENT-STANDARDS spec says zero-new-item runs should write nothing.
- **Failing RSS endpoints** (PHAC, RKI, AP News, CTV, CBC, Eurosurveillance) — find current URLs and update `GLOBAL_FEEDS` in `scripts/update-news.mjs`.
- **Status page (`/status`)** was lightly touched in the sweep — verify renders correctly after all data changes; consider adding marker / section count fields to `generate-status.mjs` output and surfacing them here.
- **Bundle size.** Main bundle is 640 kB (gzip 203 kB) — past Vite's 500 kB warning. Consider `manualChunks` or convert `news.json` to a runtime `fetch()` instead of build-time import.
- **Accessibility sweep.** AcknowledgmentModal focus trap + ESC; keyboard nav for filter chip rows; verify ARIA on map filter rows.

## Conventions & rules

### Commit style (per CONTENT-STANDARDS §8.1)
- `feat(scope): subject` — new feature
- `fix(scope): subject` — bug fix
- `chore(scope): subject` — pipeline / housekeeping
- All AI-assisted commits end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Pipeline-generated commits use `EMERGENZ Data Bot <bot@emergenz.org>`

### Push procedure
The `update-news` workflow may commit while you're working. If push is rejected:
```
git pull --rebase origin main && git push origin main
```

### Verification cadence
- After each implementation: `npm run validate:data` and `npm run build` (TypeScript + Vite)
- For observable UI: `npm run dev` and visit the affected route. Use `preview_eval` / `preview_snapshot` if the screenshot tool times out (known issue).

### Source attribution
- Tier 1 (WHO/CDC/ECDC) drives structured data
- Tier 2 (PHAC, UKHSA, RKI, journals) drives structured data
- Tier 3 (news outlets) → news feed only
- Tier 4 (preprints) must be labeled
- Per CONTENT-STANDARDS §4.1, never fabricate. Use `null` (rendered as `—` or `TBD`) when uncertain.

---

## Known issues / deferred

- **Custom domain `biosecurity-intel.emergenzsystems.org`** does not resolve. Workflows currently point at `biosecurity-intel-dashboard.vercel.app`. Swap back once DNS is configured (or use env var).
- **Vercel CLI auth** is invalid on this machine; deploy plumbing is owned by the user.
- **Several RSS feeds 404 or 403** (PHAC, RKI, AP News, CTV News, Eurosurveillance). The pipeline tolerates these — they're Tier 2/3 non-critical. Update the URLs in `scripts/update-news.mjs` `GLOBAL_FEEDS` when better endpoints are identified.
- **Pipeline behavior gap vs CONTENT-STANDARDS §4.4** — current `update-news.mjs` writes news.json even when zero new items are added. Per spec, zero-new-item runs should write nothing. Low priority; the file is checked-in either way.
